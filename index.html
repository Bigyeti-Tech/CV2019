        Well, after quite a long time, I felt it was time to rebuild my site. As anyone will tell you, I used to rebuild my site with a completely different look and feel maybe every year or so. I can't believe I've left it this long to be honest.

        Although I’ve been a full stack developer of one form or another for almost 20 years, I am currently looking for frontend contract position, I'm available immediately and am willing to relocate.  My main aim is to keep up with new technologies and I am always building on my skillset and most recently have been working with Vue.js with Firebase, and am currently looking into React with Redux.
